# Pajoniiir BL-A1800

Standalone dual-deck DJ system built around a Pioneer DDJ-FLX4, a Seeed
Studio XIAO ESP32S3 control board and a JC4880P443C_I_W ESP32-P4 multimedia
board. It reads Rekordbox media directly and does not require a PC during
performance.

Canonical repository: `https://github.com/dvucinozd/Pajoniiir.git`. The former
`dvucinozd/ESP32-DDJ-FLX4` URL is deprecated and retained only as a GitHub
redirect. A branch audit on 2026-07-26 cleaned up all helper branches, and the
active development now lives on the `codex/ddj400-jc1060-integration` branch
(local and on `origin`); `master` remains the stable release baseline.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ESP-IDF 6.0.2 migration is **merged into `master`**; both targets now
> build only under **ESP-IDF v6.0.2** (the component manifests pin
> `idf: "==6.0.2"`). The release prefix therefore moved from `RC1` to **`RC2`**,
> and the latest clean dual-target release build is **`RC2`** (`56905c89`) from
> 2026-07-30 — see
> [CLEAN_RELEASE_RC2_BUILD.md](docs/validation/CLEAN_RELEASE_RC2_BUILD.md). It
> was signed, packaged and installed successfully through OTA on both boards
> on 2026-08-02. It carries the full
> `fix/release-blockers-and-concurrency` stabilisation set (bounded compressed
> audio cache, paginated Library UI, immutable track sort, recorder safety
> hardening, lossless control queue, ANLZ ownership fixes and more).
>
> RC2 hardware acceptance is now **in progress**. Both targets have complete
> ESP-IDF v6.0.2 boot chains; the P4 microSD regression is fixed, and a focused
> 2026-08-02 smoke passed display/touch/Library, FLX4 MIDI/LED, MAIN/headphone
> audio and real-MP3 playback. Real WAV/FLAC cache testing was not performed:
> the Rekordbox database referenced files that were absent from the USB drive.
> Long-duration, USB recovery and fault-injection rows remain open in
> [ESP_IDF_6_0_2_MIGRATION.md](docs/migration/ESP_IDF_6_0_2_MIGRATION.md), so
> the latest **complete** functional hardware baseline remains
> **`RC1-123-g587cd7a1`** of 2026-07-14. See
> [Documentation Status](docs/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md) for the precise boundary.
>
> A later P4-only signed development update installed
> `RC2-51-g050ab43` into `ota_0` on 2026-08-22 and reached `valid`. COM15
> confirmed the 29,520 MB SDHC mount and, after one physical USB reinsert, an
> exFAT library load of 324 tracks. The already-inserted USB medium had first
> exhausted eight automatic enumeration-recovery cycles, so the reboot recovery
> row remains open. The S3 was not updated in that session and continued to
> report `RC2-44-g1923a3b`. See
> [RC2-51 P4 OTA deployment](docs/validation/RC2_51_P4_OTA_DEPLOYMENT_20260822.md).

## System at a Glance

| Device | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **Pioneer DDJ-FLX4** | Operator surface: transport, jogs, tempo, mixer, pads, cue and LEDs |
| **XIAO ESP32S3** | USB MIDI host, semantic event translator, LED bridge, FLX4 USB-headphone streamer and service OTA AP |
| **ESP32-P4 board** | Authoritative playback/deck state, Rekordbox library, LVGL UI, audio DSP/mixer and MAIN/cue routing |

The S3 normalizes FLX4 input but does not own playback state. The P4 makes all
authoritative deck, mixer, audio-position and LED decisions. Both boards use
the existing `0xA5` UART control link, extended with the `0xA6` bulk/status
layer. The detailed ownership and data flow are documented in
[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Current Capabilities

- Two independent decks with Rekordbox library browsing and MP3, WAV and FLAC
  playback. Compressed audio uses a bounded LRU page cache (8 × 32 KiB per
  deck) instead of whole-file PSRAM allocation. The current WAV subset is
  classic RIFF/WAVE PCM16 mono/stereo.
- FLX4 transport, jog/vinyl scratch, tempo and Master Tempo, mixer/EQ,
  headphone cue, hot cues, loops, beat jump/sync, Pad FX and Beat FX control.
  All Beat FX (Filter, Echo, Flanger and the one-shot Delay) have recorded
  hardware acceptance (2026-07-24).
- Simultaneous PCM5102A RCA MAIN output and FLX4 USB headphone cue.
- P4-owned FLX4 LED feedback with reconnect and board-reboot resynchronization.
- LVGL Overview, Library (paginated 8-row table with PREV/NEXT), Hot Cues and
  Settings tabs, plus the optional P4 Wi-Fi remote.
- Data-driven controller profiles loaded from SD or installed through the web
  UI; the built-in DDJ-FLX4 map remains the fallback. The web overwrite path is
  software-complete and still has pending hardware-acceptance rows. A
  host-qualified Hercules DJControl Inpulse 500 profile is included; physical
  MIDI/LED/reconnect and USB-audio qualification remains pending.
- Signed dual-slot OTA, validation and rollback on both processors.

## Upcoming Targets

The following integration runs on the active
`codex/ddj400-jc1060-integration` branch (committed):

- **Pioneer DDJ-400 on the JC1060 target**: controller support via a
  data-driven profile compiled from the Mixxx FLX4 mapping XML (which is
  "based on DDJ-400 mapping"); the profile is installed as
  `/sd/controllers/pioneer_ddj_400/profile.s3bin` using
  `tools/controller_profile/compile_profile.py` and was confirmed on a real
  DDJ-400 through HIL testing. The earlier `MIDI_MAP_RESEARCH.md` /
  `ddj400_midi_ci` research is **invalid** (invented addresses) and is kept
  only as an archived warning. MIDI, LED and UAC audio paths run through the
  same `controller_*` components as the FLX4.
- **JC4880P443C_I_W / JC1060 7" display** ESP32-P4 target: hardware bring-up
  COMPLETE (display, touch, Ethernet, USB host). Since then: USB MSC media
  mounting with hub-port routing (v160-v169), end-to-end pull OTA over
  Ethernet (v126) with flicker-free PSRAM XIP (v142-v147), and a working
  USB-audio (UAC) path to the DDJ-400 (44.1 kHz, 4-channel, 24-bit, hot DSP
  code relocated to internal RAM, v211-v215). See
  [`firmware/main-deck-jc1060/BRING_UP_GUIDE.md`](firmware/main-deck-jc1060/BRING_UP_GUIDE.md)
  and [`docs/recherche/eth-jc1060p470-phy-is-busy.md`](docs/recherche/eth-jc1060p470-phy-is-busy.md).

Detailed implementation and acceptance status belongs in
[Project Overview](docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md),
[Development Plan](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) and
[Documentation Status](docs/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md), rather than in this
repository entry page.

## Build and Test

Required baseline: **ESP-IDF v6.0.2** and its matching Espressif Python and
toolchain environment. Host tests additionally require native GCC/Make and
PowerShell 5.1 (or newer) on Windows, or a standard shell on Linux.

A standard ESP-IDF installation is initialized on Windows with the Espressif
profile (v6.0.2 lives at `C:\Espressif\v6.0.2\esp-idf` — **not** under
`frameworks\` or `.espressif\`):

```powershell
. C:\Espressif\tools\Microsoft.v6.0.2.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

Verify the selected environment before configuring either target:

```powershell
idf.py --version
```

It must report `ESP-IDF v6.0.2`. For the first build after switching from IDF
5.5.4, remove the previous generated configuration and managed components:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build, managed_components -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item sdkconfig, sdkconfig.old -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Build each target from the repository root:

```powershell
cd firmware\control-board-s3
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build

cd ..\main-deck-p4
idf.py set-target esp32p4
idf.py build
```

Run the host regression suites from the repository root. These are the same two
entry points CI uses, and both run under Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7:

```powershell
.\tests\run_s3_host_tests.ps1
.\tests\run_p4_host_tests.ps1
```

If `gcc` is not already on `PATH`, append msys2 rather than prepending it —
prepending shadows the system `python.exe` with msys2's, which cannot run the
OTA signing suite:

```powershell
$env:Path = "$env:Path;C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin"
```

Run the headless LVGL navigation and exact-framebuffer screenshot gate:

```powershell
.\tests\ui_simulator\run_ui_simulator_e2e.ps1
```

For hardware-in-the-loop work (serial capture, build, OTA serve) the repo
ships `tools/hil.sh`; see its header and
[Startup Checklist](docs/STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md) for the first-flash procedure.

The first run fetches the pinned LVGL source into the ignored `.cache`
directory. The gate covers Overview Deck 1/2 selection, Library, Hot Cues,
Settings, the screensaver and exact Settings restoration. See
[`tests/ui_simulator/README.md`](tests/ui_simulator/README.md) for baseline
review and update instructions. This PC gate does not replace P4 display,
touch or waveform-motion hardware acceptance.

Both default firmware configurations include the FLX4 USB-headphone path.
Build, flashing, signed release packaging and rollback procedures are covered
by [OTA Update](docs/OTA-UPDATE.md). Hardware bring-up and recurring acceptance
checks are in the [Startup Checklist](docs/STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md).
