# Control Link Protocol

Status: current wire protocol, audited 2026-07-16. The fixed `0xA5` event layer
and variable-length `0xA6` bulk layer are both active in production firmware.

Pajoniiir keeps the inherited UART `control_link` as the internal protocol
between the ESP32-S3 and ESP32-P4.

## Current Frame

```text
[0] 0xA5        start byte
[1] type        event or command type
[2] id          control id
[3] val_lo      value LSB
[4] val_hi      value MSB
[5] seq         rolling sequence counter
[6] checksum    XOR of bytes [1]..[5]
```

Baud rate: `460800` (8N1). Both boards must match; see `UART_BAUD` in each side's `control_link_uart.c`.

## Existing Types

| Direction | Type | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| S3 -> P4 | `0x01` | button |
| S3 -> P4 | `0x02` | encoder |
| S3 -> P4 | `0x03` | pitch |
| S3 -> P4 | `0x04` | heartbeat |
| S3 -> P4 | `0x82` | semantic state: FLX4 USB connection state, S3 Debug AP status |
| P4 -> S3 | `0x81` | LED |
| P4 -> S3 | `0x82` | semantic command: S3 Debug AP enable request |
| both | `0xA6` | variable-length bulk frame: controller/profile data + firmware status (see [0xA6 Bulk Frame Layer](#0xa6-bulk-frame-layer-controller-profiles-and-firmware-status)) |

The `0xA6` byte starts a separate variable-length frame that never collides
with the fixed 7-byte `0xA5` frame; a receiver routes on the start byte.

## Pajoniiir Semantic Namespace

The current frame has only one `id` byte and one 16-bit value. Pajoniiir keeps
that wire format for MVP and makes the `id` namespace deck-aware instead.

Implemented namespace layout:

```text
id range:       deck, mixer, browser, or system namespace
deck control:   id - deck namespace base (32 controls per deck)
value:          signed delta, 0/1 button state, or 0..16383 absolute value
```

Suggested namespaces:

| Namespace | ID range | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Deck 1 | `0x10`-`0x2F` | transport, jog, tempo, loop, pad mode/action |
| Deck 2 | `0x30`-`0x4F` | transport, jog, tempo, loop, pad mode/action |
| Mixer | `0x50`-`0x5F` | channel faders, crossfader, PFL, trim/EQ/filter monitor controls |
| Browser | `0x60`-`0x6F` | browse/load/navigation |
| System | `0x70`-`0x7F` | heartbeat, diagnostics, global system/audio controls |

The S3 and P4 headers carry matching constants for this layout. Host tests
verify that the shared MVP IDs, Smart control IDs, and FLX4 connection state
IDs stay aligned across both firmware targets.

This avoids changing the wire frame before the first MVP hardware integration
test.

| `0x89` | S3 maintenance token low | S3->P4 `CTRL_TYPE_STATE`; lower three decimal digits (`000..999`); P4 publishes the code only after an ordered `0x88`/`0x89` pair |

In S3 translator mode, `flx4_map` converts the DDJ-FLX4 MIDI controls from
`docs/DDJ_FLX4_MIDI_MAP.md` into these semantic IDs. Queue/backpressure behavior
depends on event semantics:

- continuous absolute controls retain the latest observed value, while relative
  jog/browse deltas are accumulated before UART or deck-queue delivery;
- physical held levels use a shared 54-slot desired/scheduled/dirty reconciler
  on both S3 and P4. This covers Deck 1/2 jog touch, Shift, Censor, all Pad FX 1
  and Pad FX 2 pads, and shifted Beat Loop roll pads. A full queue may delay a
  level transition, but it cannot erase the latest desired press/release;
- discrete commands such as Play, Cue, Load, PFL, browse actions and toggle
  requests remain FIFO with bounded enqueue and sequence-gap telemetry.

Producers never drain, reorder, or evict unrelated entries from a shared queue.
Held-state dirty slots are flushed before pending continuous values whenever
consumer capacity returns. Reliable delivery of arbitrary repeated discrete
commands remains a separate future protocol-hardening concern; if field
telemetry shows that sequence-gap detection is insufficient, the compatible
next step is command ACK/retry rather than treating commands as levels.

`CTRL_ID_HEADPHONE_LEVEL`, `CTRL_ID_SMART_CFX_SHIFT`,
`CTRL_ID_SMART_FADER_SHIFT`, `CTRL_ID_BEAT_FX_BEAT_DEC_SHIFT`, and
`CTRL_ID_BEAT_FX_BEAT_INC_SHIFT` are literal `0x7D`, `0x7E`, `0x7F`, `0x83`,
and `0x84` values in both firmware targets because the current namespace
encoding aliases `CTRL_NS_SYSTEM | offset` values above `0x0F`.

Pad action values are packed into the signed 16-bit `value` field:

- bits `0..2`: pad index `0..7`;
- bits `3..5`: pad mode `0..7` (`HOT_CUE`, `BEAT_LOOP`, `BEAT_JUMP`,
  retained compatibility values for out-of-scope `KEY_SHIFT` and `KEYBOARD`,
  `PAD_FX1`, `PAD_FX2`, and retained compatibility value for out-of-scope
  `SAMPLER`);
- bit `6`: shifted pad action;
- bit `7`: pressed state.

Deck extended action values are packed into the signed 16-bit `value` field:

- bits `0..6`: `CTRL_DECK_EXT_ACTION_*`;
- bit `7`: pressed state.

## LED Feedback

The P4 sends LED commands only from confirmed state. For example, Deck 1
Play LED turns on only when P4 `deck_core` confirms Deck 1 is playing.

The current MVP LED payload uses inherited `led_id_t` values with the deck
packed into the high byte of the 16-bit value by `control_link_send_led_deck()`:

| LED ID | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0x00` | Cue |
| `0x01` | Play |
| `0x04` | PFL |
| `0x05` | VU meter level |
| `0x06` | Pad mode: Hot Cue |
| `0x07` | Pad mode: Keyboard/Stems compatibility ID; kept OFF/ignored |
| `0x08` | Pad mode: Pad FX1 |
| `0x09` | Pad mode: Pad FX2 |
| `0x0A` | Pad mode: Beat Jump |
| `0x0B` | Pad mode: Beat Loop |
| `0x0C` | Pad mode: Sampler compatibility ID; kept OFF/ignored |
| `0x0D` | Pad mode: Key Shift compatibility ID; kept OFF/ignored |
| `0x0E` | Beat Sync enabled |
| `0x0F` | Loop In indicator |
| `0x10` | Loop Out indicator |
| `0x34` | Master Cue monitor indicator |
| `0x35` | Censor active indicator |
| `0x36` | Cue+Shift / track-start output candidate |
| `0x37` | Loop Adjust In output candidate |
| `0x38` | Loop Adjust Out output candidate |
| `0x39` | Track Load Deck 1 illumination output candidate |
| `0x3A` | Track Load Deck 2 illumination output candidate |

`LED_REMOTE_COUNT` is `59`. Existing values through `LED_MASTER_CUE` remain
stable; the new FLX4 official/PDF output IDs are appended after
`LED_MASTER_CUE`.

```text
value low byte:  LED state, 0 off / 1 on / 2 blink
value high byte: deck, 0 Deck 1 / 1 Deck 2
```

States remain inherited:

- `0`: off
- `1`: on
- `2`: blink

`LED_VU_METER` uses the same deck-aware LED frame but interprets the low byte
as a FLX4 VU level `0..127`. P4 samples per-deck audio peaks from the output
path, resets the peak when read, and publishes levels at a controlled 30 ms
period. S3 forwards this as USB MIDI CC `0x02` on `0xB0` for Deck/Channel 1 and
`0xB1` for Deck/Channel 2.

P4 also owns reconnect recovery. When S3 reports
`CTRL_TYPE_STATE / CTRL_ID_FLX4_CONNECTION / CTRL_FLX4_CONNECTED`, P4 forces a
P4-owned LED snapshot for Deck 1/2 Cue, Play, PFL, selected supported pad mode,
Beat Sync enabled state, active Loop In/Out state, Beat Loop pad state,
momentary Pad FX pad state, Censor active state, Smart CFX/Fader state, the
global Beat FX ON/OFF enabled state, Track Load Deck 1/2 illumination, and the
global Master Cue monitor state.
Host tests verify normal diff
suppression, failed-send retry, and forced reconnect publication. Transport
reconnect smoke has passed for Play/Cue/PFL, extended pad-mode/sync/loop
reconnect, USB replug, S3 reset, and P4 heartbeat connected-state refresh where
recorded in the startup checklist.

The new Censor LED is snapshot-driven from P4 `deck_state_t.censor_active`.
Cue+Shift / track-start, Loop Adjust In, and Loop Adjust Out are P4-owned
momentary LED flashes. Track Load Deck 1/2 illumination follows P4 audio-engine
loaded state and is included in reconnect refresh. Beat Jump normal pad LEDs and
shifted helper LEDs 7/8 are implemented from P4 loaded-track/mode/shift state.
Sampler, Keyboard/Stems, and Key Shift mode/pad behavior is out of product scope
as of 2026-07-07; their numeric IDs remain reserved for compatibility and
reconnect OFF output only.

In DDJ-FLX4 translator mode, S3 retains connection desired/sent/dirty state and
periodically refreshes both the connected and disconnected levels. UART send
failure leaves the level dirty. This is level-triggered recovery in addition to
edge-triggered USB connect/disconnect: a lost disconnect self-corrects without
a second replug, and if P4 reboots while S3 and the FLX4 stay powered, the next
refresh lets the freshly booted P4 force its LED snapshot. Descriptor replay is
tracked separately and occurs only for an active connection.

After a successful heartbeat-driven FLX4 connection refresh, S3 also replays
the last known FLX4 input state to P4 in two semantic groups:

- observed absolute controls: channel faders, crossfader, trim/pregain, EQ
  high/mid/low, channel filter, Master Level, Headphones Mix, Headphone Level,
  and Beat FX Level/Depth;
- observed physical held levels tracked by the reconciler: Deck 1/2 jog touch,
  Shift, Censor, Pad FX 1/2 pads and shifted Beat Loop roll pads.

S3 does not fabricate defaults for unknown physical positions, and the USB MIDI
class does not expose a generic "read all knobs now" request. Tempo faders,
discrete/toggle/action buttons, PFL, browse actions and relative jog deltas are
deliberately excluded because replaying them could create false user actions or
disable Beat Sync. Repeated held snapshots are suppressed after the value is
scheduled within one P4 lifetime; a newly booted P4 starts with an empty
reconciler and therefore accepts the same still-held snapshot. An FLX4
disconnect first converts every observed held level into a release and only
then publishes the disconnected state, preventing stale scratch/Shift/pad
latches.

The current P4 Beat FX snapshot is exposed through `/api/status` under
`beat_fx` for low-rate hardware smoke verification without raw MIDI logging.
The object contains `effect`, its additive human-readable `effect_name`,
`beat`, `target`, `depth`, and `enabled`; numeric effect values are `0=NONE`,
`1=FILTER`, `2=ECHO`, `3=FLANGER`, and `4=DELAY`. The new
DELAY value does not change the wire protocol: S3 still sends only the semantic
Next/Previous events above, and P4 owns selection/state. DELAY is a full-band
one-shot repeat with Level/Depth as wet gain, while ECHO remains a damped
multi-repeat feedback effect. Time is derived from effective BPM when a Beat FX
state-changing event applies the audio state; it is not automatically retimed
by a later tempo, Beat Sync or track-load change. The valid BPM range is
40–300, with a 120 BPM fallback. Both modes cap delay time at 1000 ms; target
BOTH currently derives one shared time from Deck 1 BPM. They share the existing
per-deck stereo delay line without an additional PSRAM allocation.
`NONE` is a compatibility sentinel only; CLEAR restores disabled FILTER,
beat `1`, target BOTH and depth `64`. Diagnostics retain the `beat_fx_echo`
compatibility object with per-deck fields `allocated1/2`, `enabled1/2`,
`mode1/2` and `delay_ms1/2`. `mode1/2` is the last commanded/retained shared
lane mode, and `delay_ms1/2` becomes zero while that lane is disabled.
`enabled1/2` means the DSP lane is actually active: top-level Beat FX is ON,
depth is nonzero, that deck is targeted, and its buffer is allocated. It can
therefore be false while top-level `beat_fx.enabled` and the controller LED are
true. Tail-ringing state is not exposed. Use top-level
`beat_fx.effect_name` as the selected-effect authority. Flanger and DELAY
hardware smoke remains pending.

The audio engine, not `deck_core`, maps raw depth through a square-root wet
taper up to 0.70. Echo feedback spans 0.20–0.68; Delay forces feedback to zero.
Wet/feedback gains ramp, but a live beat-size change moves the delay read head
immediately without time interpolation. On switch-off or CLEAR, Echo can ring
for about 2 s and Delay keeps exactly its previous delay period so the pending
tap can leave the line. A live Echo↔Delay mode change resets the shared line;
tail state is intentionally absent from the diagnostics object.
The top-level Beat FX `enabled` state also drives the physical FLX4 Beat FX
ON/OFF LED via `LED_BEAT_FX_ON`. The production P4 snapshot emits the
global/deck-1 LED lane,
which S3 maps to note `0x47` on `0x94`; the generic S3 encoder also supports the
deck-2 `0x95` form for profile/compatibility use.

The physical FLX4 MASTER CUE button is mapped from the official MIDI list to
`CTRL_ID_MASTER_CUE` (`0x96/0x63`, shifted `0x96/0x78`). P4 owns the monitor
state: a button press toggles whether the master side contributes to the
headphone/monitor mix, while the main/RCA master output remains unchanged.
The P4 LED snapshot includes `LED_MASTER_CUE`; S3 maps it to output note
`0x63` on `0x96`.

Pad mode LEDs are also P4-owned. `deck_core` stores controller `pad_mode`
separately from the legacy `perf_mode`, so deferred modes such as `PAD_FX1`,
`PAD_FX2`, `KEYBOARD`, and `SAMPLER` can still drive LED state without implying
that their pad behavior is implemented. The S3 maps these LED IDs to the
XML-derived FLX4 MIDI output notes and sends exactly one active pad-mode LED per
deck in the P4 snapshot.

Pad FX pad LED feedback is also P4-owned. `deck_core` stores the current
momentary Pad FX pad press per deck and publishes normal Pad FX1/Pad FX2 pad
LEDs through the same snapshot path. The LEDs follow the physical press/release
state only; Pad FX Echo audio tails intentionally continue after release without
holding the pad LED on.

Beat Sync LED feedback is P4-owned from `deck_core.sync_enabled`. Pressing Beat
Sync toggles the target deck's sync state, applies the current one-shot BPM
match and signed intra-beat phase-align behavior, republishes the LED snapshot,
and S3 maps `LED_SYNC` to USB MIDI note `0x58` on `0x90`/`0x91`.

Loop In and Loop Out LED feedback is also P4-owned. P4 combines the deck-core
pending loop-in marker with the authoritative per-deck audio loop state from
`audio_engine_deck_get_loop_state()`. `LED_LOOP_IN` turns on as soon as Loop In
sets a pending marker and remains on while an active loop exists. `LED_LOOP_OUT`
turns on only after Loop Out closes an active loop. S3 maps those LED IDs to USB
MIDI notes `0x10` and `0x11` on `0x90`/`0x91`.

## S3 Debug AP Control

`CTRL_ID_S3_DEBUG_AP` (`0x85`) drives the runtime, bench-only S3 Wi-Fi debug
access point and live log viewer (see `docs/S3_WIFI_DEBUG_LOG.md`). It is a
diagnostic control, not an audio/deck control, and rides on the existing 7-byte
frame with `CTRL_TYPE_STATE` (`0x82`) in both directions.

Request (P4 -> S3):

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| type | `CTRL_TYPE_STATE` (`0x82`) |
| id | `CTRL_ID_S3_DEBUG_AP` (`0x85`) |
| value | `0` request OFF, `1` request ON |

Status feedback (S3 -> P4), `ctrl_s3_debug_ap_status_t`:

| Value | Status | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0` | `OFF` | AP and HTTP server stopped |
| `1` | `STARTING` | S3 is bringing up SoftAP/HTTP |
| `2` | `ON` | WPA2 AP live at `Pajoniiir-S3-DEBUG` / `http://192.168.4.1` |
| `3` | `ERROR` | start failed; S3 tore down partial state and stays OFF |

Handshake and ownership:

- The switch lives only in the **P4 Settings UI**. It is **not** persisted in P4
  NVS and always initializes OFF after a P4 boot.
- On P4 boot (and after S3 reconnect recovery) P4 sends `0x85 = 0` as a safe
  reset so the debug AP never lingers active across a reboot.
- The P4 UI toggle calls `control_link_send_state(CTRL_ID_S3_DEBUG_AP, 0/1)`.
- S3 dispatches the request to `s3_debug_ap_request()` and reports every state
  transition back through its status callback, which P4 `deck_core` forwards to
  the Settings label (`OFF` / `STARTING` / `ON` / `ERROR`).
- Each ON edge generates a new six-digit maintenance code. S3 sends its high and
  low three-digit halves as ordered `0x88`/`0x89` state frames. P4 discards an
  out-of-order low half and clears the displayed code on `STARTING`, `OFF` or
  `ERROR`; the complete code is shown only while the AP reports `ON`.
- The published WPA2 password permits association but does not authorize a
  mutation. `POST /api/ota/s3` additionally requires the current maintenance
  code. It expires after ten minutes, locks after five failures and is cleared
  when the AP stops. The AP automatically shuts down after fifteen minutes.
- FLX4 MIDI, control-link UART, and P4-to-S3 headphone audio must keep running
  regardless of debug AP state; a start failure only yields `ERROR`.

The `control_link_protocol` host test asserts `CTRL_ID_S3_DEBUG_AP` and the
`CTRL_S3_DEBUG_AP_*` status enum stay byte-for-byte aligned across both targets.

## 0xA6 Bulk Frame Layer (controller profiles and firmware status)

The 7-byte `0xA5` frame carries small semantic events. Payloads that do not fit
it — the connected-controller descriptor, compiled controller profiles, and S3
firmware report — use a second, variable-length frame type on the **same UART**,
distinguished by a different start byte (`0xA6`). This is the transport for the
data-driven multi-controller platform (see `docs/CONTROLLER_PROFILE_SCHEMA.md`)
and low-rate system metadata.

Frame layout:

```text
[0] 0xA6        start byte
[1] type        CTRL_BULK_TYPE_* below
[2] seq         rolling sequence counter
[3] len         payload length, 0..128
[4..4+len)      payload
[4+len]         crc16_lo
[5+len]         crc16_hi
```

`crc16` is CRC16-CCITT (poly `0x1021`, init `0xFFFF`, no reflection) over bytes
`[1 .. 4+len)`. The frame codec (`ctrl_bulk.c`) and the profile-transfer
receiver (`cp_xfer.c`) are kept **byte-for-byte identical** on the S3 and P4
sides; the S3 host runner asserts the two file copies match, and
`control_link_protocol` asserts the shared constants agree.

On S3, every fixed `0xA5` and bulk `0xA6` sender uses one TX serializer. The
serializer holds a static mutex across rolling-sequence allocation, full frame
construction and the complete UART write. Failed writes consume their sequence
so a later valid frame exposes the loss through P4 `sequence_gaps` telemetry;
two producers cannot reserve sequence values in one order and reach the wire in
the opposite order.

### P4 receive-health telemetry

The P4 counts every valid S3-to-P4 `0xA5` and `0xA6` frame against the S3's
shared rolling sequence. The first valid frame establishes the baseline;
subsequent non-contiguous values increment one `sequence_gaps` event, including
across the `255 -> 0` wrap. Invalid `0xA5` checksums and invalid `0xA6`
CRC/format frames increment separate counters and are not accepted as sequence
baselines.

`GET /api/status` exposes the snapshot under `control_link`:
`connected`, `heartbeat_age_ms`, `rx_frames`, `sequence_gaps`, combined
`crc_errors`, `event_checksum_errors`, `bulk_frames`, `bulk_crc_errors`,
`last_sequence`, and `sequence_valid`. The periodic P4 health monitor also
emits `CONTROL_LINK_CRC_ERROR` and `CONTROL_LINK_GAP` service-journal records
when their totals change. These are low-rate summaries, not a raw UART trace.

The same status response exposes service-journal health under `service_log`:
`available`, `queue_depth`, `queue_capacity`, `dropped`, `written`,
`current_bytes`, and `last_error`.

### Controller descriptor report (S3 -> P4)

When the S3 opens a controller it sends `CONTROLLER_DESCRIPTOR` with VID, PID,
capability bits (`CTRL_DESC_CAP_MIDI_IN/MIDI_OUT/USB_AUDIO`), a nonzero 32-bit
connection epoch, and a 32-byte product string. The S3 increments the epoch for
each accepted USB connection. The report is re-sent with every connection-state
publish and heartbeat refresh, so a P4-only reboot re-learns the controller. The P4
`controller_profile_manager` matches the VID/PID against profiles on the SD/TF
card and selects the active profile. Repeated reports are accepted only for the
same VID/PID and epoch; an older epoch or a different identity reusing the same
epoch is rejected.

Payload (`42` bytes):

```text
[0..2)    vid               u16 little-endian
[2..4)    pid               u16 little-endian
[4..6)    capability bits   u16 little-endian
[6..10)   connection_epoch  u32 little-endian, nonzero
[10..42)  product           32-byte NUL-padded string
```

The S3 also sends the semantic
`CTRL_ID_FLX4_CONNECTION=CTRL_FLX4_DISCONNECTED` state when the USB controller
closes. P4 treats that state as the authoritative removal edge, clears only the
live controller/profile selection (the scanned profile inventory remains
loaded), sends `PROFILE_CLEAR`, cancels activation of an in-flight stale
transfer, and emits one
`CONTROLLER_DISCONNECTED` service-journal record. A later descriptor can match
and activate the controller again.

### Profile transfer (P4 -> S3)

On a VID/PID match the P4 streams the compiled `.s3bin` to the S3 off the RX
task: `BEGIN`, sequential in-order `CHUNK`s (each with a byte offset so a drop
is caught immediately), then `END`. The S3 reassembles into a buffer, verifies
the transfer `crc32`, and `ACK`s (or `NACK`s with `ctrl_profile_nack_t`:
`SIZE`/`STATE`/`OFFSET`/`CRC`/`PARSE`). The P4 then sends `ACTIVATE`; the S3
parses the stored blob and installs it as the active profile. The P4 sender
waits for each stage's ACK with retry + timeout; a `NACK` restarts the transfer.
Because the S3CP file carries its own internal crc32 in addition to the
transfer crc32, a profile is double-checked before use.

At `PROFILE_BEGIN`, S3 additionally requires the advertised VID/PID to match
its current USB connection and captures that connection's epoch. Activation is
accepted only while the same VID/PID/epoch is still current. A disconnect
clears the stored runtime binding, built-in snapshot, scheduler state, and held
inputs; late frames from the retired transfer cannot activate the old session.

### S3 firmware report (S3 -> P4)

S3 sends `FIRMWARE_REPORT` immediately with its first heartbeat and every five
seconds afterward. Periodic publication lets a P4-only reboot recover the peer
status without adding a request/response state machine.

Payload (`34` bytes):

```text
[0]      slot     0 unknown, 1 ota_0, 2 ota_1, 3 factory
[1]      state    0 unknown, 1 new, 2 pending_verify, 3 valid,
                  4 invalid, 5 aborted
[2..34)  version  32-byte NUL-padded ESP app version
```

P4 stores the latest report under a short critical section. Settings shows the
real P4 and S3 version/slot/state, and P4 `GET /api/firmware` includes the same
S3 data. The report carries metadata only; firmware binaries are never
forwarded over UART.

For OTA acceptance, the nested P4 response field `s3.state` is the S3
ESP-IDF image state from this report and can be used to confirm `valid`. The
top-level `state` returned by either target's own HTTP OTA service is instead
the transfer state (`idle`, `receiving`, `ready_to_reboot` or `failed`) and must
not be misread as partition validity.

### S3 pending-image boot health (`0x86` / `0x87`)

The normal heartbeat is S3->P4 and therefore cannot prove that the reverse
direction or the P4 receiver is alive. While the running S3 image is
`PENDING_VERIFY`, S3 first waits for its UART RX, heartbeat, translator, USB
host-library and USB MIDI-client tasks to enter their run loops. It then sends a
fresh random 16-bit `CTRL_ID_S3_BOOT_CHALLENGE` every 500 ms for at most 30 s.

P4 consumes the challenge directly in its UART RX task and echoes the exact
value as `CTRL_ID_S3_BOOT_ACK`. S3 rejects an ACK before local task liveness is
established and rejects any value that does not match the current boot's
challenge. Only the combination of local liveness and an exact ACK permits
`esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()`. Timeout restarts the still-pending
image so the ESP-IDF rollback path remains authoritative. FLX4 presence is not
part of this gate: the USB host tasks must run, but no controller has to be
attached.

### Dynamic mapping and controller quarantine

Once a profile is active, the S3 maps controller MIDI IN through the profile's
input table (`controller_profile_runtime`) instead of the built-in `flx4_map`,
and maps P4 LED frames through the profile's output table instead of
`flx4_led_midi`. An active dynamic profile is authoritative: an unmapped LED is
dropped and never falls through to vendor-specific FLX4 output. The built-in
map is enabled only when the current USB descriptor confirms the FLX4 VID/PID
and no dynamic profile is active. Every other controller remains quarantined
until a profile for its current connection epoch is activated. The FLX4
`profile.s3bin` is proven byte-equivalent to the built-in map by a golden-parity
host test, so the dynamic path reproduces the built-in behaviour exactly.

## Future Protocol Versioning

After MVP, consider a versioned 8-byte or 9-byte frame with explicit deck and
control fields. Do not change frame length before the first S3/P4 integration
test unless the 7-byte frame blocks a real requirement.
