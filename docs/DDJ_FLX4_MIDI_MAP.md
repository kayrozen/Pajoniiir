# DDJ-FLX4 MIDI Map

Status: current mapping and acceptance ledger, audited 2026-07-16. `Implemented`
means a firmware path exists; hardware acceptance is stated separately per row
or section. XML supplies addresses, never standalone runtime behavior.

Source file:
[docs/reference/Pioneer-DDJ-FLX4.midi.xml](reference/Pioneer-DDJ-FLX4.midi.xml)

Additional official controller MIDI list:
[docs/reference/DDJ-FLX4_MIDI_message_List.md](reference/DDJ-FLX4_MIDI_message_List.md)

The XML is a Mixxx controller preset. Physical capture on 2026-06-14 confirmed
that all MVP control addresses and encodings below match the connected
DDJ-FLX4. Remaining controls may therefore use the XML as the implementation
seed for status, midino, message type, deck/shift channel, and 14-bit pairing.
The official Pioneer MIDI message list is also tracked as a reference for
controller-visible input/output notes, especially illumination and settings
rows that are not present in the Mixxx XML. If the official list, XML, and
hardware smoke disagree, record the conflict here and do not implement behavior
until the hardware path is verified.

The XML is not executable runtime logic. `Script-Binding` entries identify MIDI
addresses, but the standalone behavior must be defined as a semantic S3 event
and P4-owned state transition. Hardware capture remains the acceptance test for
each newly delivered control group, and any difference must be recorded here.

Additional physical capture on 2026-06-20 verified SMART CFX and SMART FADER
button inputs. They are implemented as semantic press/release events that toggle
P4-owned Smart CFX and Smart Fader state; Smart CFX drives the P4 filter DSP and
Smart Fader drives the conservative transition-assist curve.

## Deck Channels

## Tempo, Mixer, And Cue

The FLX4 sends several analog controls as 14-bit MIDI pairs. The S3 should
combine MSB/LSB into a single `0..16383` value before forwarding when both
halves are available.

hardcoded ad hoc in parser logic.

## Extended Mapping Rules

- Copy MIDI addresses and encoding from the XML; do not infer them from Mixxx
  callback names.
- Map each physical input to a semantic event. Keep playback, mixer, pad-mode,
  effect, and LED state authoritative on the P4.
- Treat shifted statuses and performance-pad modes as distinct inputs when the
  XML assigns distinct status/midino pairs.
- Do not implement a `Script-Binding` control until standalone P4 behavior is
  defined.
- Add every implemented control to an inventory table with semantic ID,
  implementation status, and hardware acceptance status.

## Phase 7 Extended Controller Inventory

This inventory is generated from the vendored Mixxx XML as the implementation
seed. It is not a claim that Mixxx behavior is implemented. Semantic IDs marked
`proposed` must be added to both S3 and P4 `control_link.h` files before
firmware uses them.

Status legend:

- **Implemented:** routed and hardware-verified in the current Pajoniiir path.
- **Mapped only:** semantic input exists, but no P4 behavior is attached yet.
- **Pending:** XML address is recorded; firmware mapping is not implemented.
- **Deferred:** address is recorded, but standalone P4 behavior is not defined.
- **Candidate LED:** XML output address is recorded; P4-driven LED feedback is
  not implemented unless explicitly noted.
- **Mapped output only:** S3 can emit the official LED packet, but P4 does not
  yet publish reconnect-safe state for that indicator.
- **Implemented snapshot output:** P4 owns the state and includes the LED in the
  reconnect-safe FLX4 snapshot.

Snapshot/reconnect note: S3 now replays the last known absolute input values
for the mixer/monitoring/effect-depth rows above after a heartbeat-driven FLX4
connection refresh. This is a known-value cache, not a physical USB query:
unknown controls are skipped, tempo faders are excluded, and buttons/toggles
are not replayed.

### Performance Pad Mode Inventory

The DDJ-FLX4 has four direct physical pad mode buttons: `HOT CUE`, `PAD FX1`,
`BEAT JUMP`, and `SAMPLER`. Secondary modes are reached with `SHIFT` plus one
of those four buttons. The Mixxx XML still lists each secondary mode as its own
MIDI note, so this table keeps the XML addresses but labels whether the control
is direct or shifted.

Project scope decision 2026-07-07: `Keyboard/Stems`, `Sampler`, and `Key Shift`
are excluded from Pajoniiir standalone behavior. Their XML addresses remain
documented for trace analysis, and the `control_link` numeric constants are kept
stable for compatibility, but S3 ignores those input messages and P4 ignores
stale/manual events for those modes.

For Pad FX performance-pad inputs, `docs/reference/DDJ-FLX4_MIDI_message_List_E1.pdf`
is the source of truth because the Mixxx XML reference does not expose the
complete Pad FX pad-action range. The official list defines Pad FX1 pads as
notes `0x10..0x17` and Pad FX2 pads as notes `0x50..0x57` on the existing Deck
1/Deck 2 pad statuses (`0x97`/`0x99`), with `0x00` off and `0x7F` on.

### Official Settings / Device Mode Inventory

These rows come from `DDJ-FLX4_MIDI_message_List.md`. They are controller
configuration messages rather than normal performance controls. Do not map them
to live P4 behavior without hardware smoke because some official-list rows
overlap with XML live-control addresses.

| Setting | Official status/midino | Encoding | Deck/shift | Semantic ID | P4 owner | Status | HW verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vinyl mode on/off | official list: D1 `0xB0/0x17`, D2 `0xB0/0x17` | CC value `0x00` off, `0x7F` on; default on | deck setting; official note says it is changed by MIDI OUT from DJ app, not from unit | none | none | Out of scope by product decision 2026-07-02 | Do not implement unless the product decision changes |

## Hardware Acceptance

The MVP capture is complete. For each additional delivered control group,
capture and verify:

- button press/release values and deck/shift status;
- relative encoder direction and acceleration range;
- 14-bit analog minimum, center, maximum, and MSB/LSB order;
- mode-dependent pad messages;
- LED output values and reconnect resynchronization.

Hardware smoke passed for the 2026-07-02 Jog Search / Master Cue slice:

- Shift + Jog rotate on Deck 1 and Deck 2 seeks by one-second steps in both
  directions and clamps at track start.
- MASTER CUE toggles only the monitor/headphone master contribution; RCA/main
  output must not change.
- MASTER CUE LED follows P4 state and recovers after FLX4 reconnect, S3 reset,
  and P4 reset snapshot refresh.
