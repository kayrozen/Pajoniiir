/*
 * Scratch DSP engine (vinyl mode Phase 3/5). Turns jog motion into audible
 * turntable scratch by walking a fractional read head over the captured PCM
 * window (audio_scratch_buffer) and linearly interpolating, forward OR reverse.
 * Pure DSP: no ESP / RTOS deps, so it is exercised in isolation by host tests.
 * Driven from the real-time output task. See docs/VINYL_SCRATCH_PLAN.md.
 *
 * Coordinate: the read head is measured in `frames back from the newest
 * captured frame` (0 = newest, larger = older) as a float, so it needs no
 * sample rate and maps directly onto audio_scratch_buffer_read_frame_back().
 * `velocity` is the FORWARD advance in source frames per output sample: positive
 * moves toward newer audio (forward playback), negative toward older (reverse),
 * so each rendered sample does `head_back -= velocity`.
 *
 * Velocity model (Phase 5 — FIXED-WINDOW rate estimate). The FLX4 platter emits
 * many small (+-1) jog ticks at a high rate; the platter SPEED is carried by the
 * tick RATE. audio_scratch_jog just banks ticks (atomic). Every
 * `rate_window_samples` rendered samples the render loop snapshots the ticks
 * banked in that window and sets the target velocity to
 * `ticks x frames_per_tick / rate_window_samples` (a rate over a CONSTANT time
 * base). It then slews the playback velocity toward that target each sample.
 * A constant divisor is the whole point: the earlier "ticks since the last tick"
 * estimate divided by a noisy, bursty render-call count (render runs 256 samples
 * then blocks on I2S), so a tick landing just after a block gave a divisor near 1
 * and an 8x velocity spike, while a tick after an idle gap gave a huge divisor
 * and ~0 velocity — the head alternately froze and shot to the window edge.
 * Between windows with no ticks the velocity HOLDS (steady motion stays
 * continuous); only after `hold_windows` empty windows does the platter count as
 * stopped and the target slew to 0 (a still record is silent, not a tone).

/* Starting parameters (tune on hardware). Calibrated from a real FLX4 capture:
 * a moderate scratch emits ~250 +-1 ticks/s (one tick per ~4 ms). velocity =
 * tick_rate x frames_per_tick / sample_rate (independent of the window size), so
 * frames_per_tick 250 puts that ~250 tick/s scratch around 1.3x, a brisk
 * ~450 tick/s scratch ~2.3x, capped at 6x.
 *
 * The window MUST be a little longer than the tick interval, or most windows
 * hold zero ticks and the hold-bridge has to paper over the gaps — which also
 * lets a single stray tick from a hand resting on the platter drift the head for
 * the whole hold time (heard as a judder-in-place instead of a clean stop). A
 * 256-sample (~5 ms) window reliably contains a tick during real motion, so the
 * hold can be short: 3 windows (~16 ms) bridges the odd gap yet snaps to silence
 * the moment the hand stops. */
