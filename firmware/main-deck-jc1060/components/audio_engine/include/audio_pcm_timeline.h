/*
 * Canonical decoded-PCM timeline.
 *
 * `write_seq` is the decoder cursor (next absolute frame to write) and
 * `play_seq` is the normal-output cursor (next frame to play). Consumed frames
 * remain addressable as history until capacity pressure overwrites them, while
 * frames between play_seq and write_seq form scratch forward runway.
 *
 * Caller owns `frames` (capacity*2 interleaved stereo int16), normally PSRAM.
 * Single producer writes; the output task owns play_seq. Random readers may
 * address any retained sequence inside [oldest_seq, write_seq). Jog scratch
 * freezes the producer because its movable window must remain stable; slip
 * Censor leaves it running and treats a concurrently evicted frame as an edge.
