/*
 * v274: loop X2 / /2 (and the IN/OUT jog, and exit) while a loop plays.
 *
 * v273 hardware: after X2 the loop still went back at its old end once, then
 * followed the new length, the waveform half a loop off the audio. The
 * decoder runs ~2 s ahead of the playhead, so the ring already holds the
 * wrap at the old end (old end -> start) when the loop changes; setting the
 * new bounds only affected the next wrap. Upstream main-deck-p4 does the
 * same (audio_engine_deck_set_loop only stores the bounds).
 *
 * The ring is right up to the first point where the old and new loops part:
 * the old end when the loop grows (or is exited), the new end when it
 * shrinks. The frames past that point are withdrawn, the playhead keeps
 * playing, and the decoder restarts there: at the old end (exactly, the
 * track continues) or at the start (a wrap). Where the decoded frames sit
 * follows from the decoder cursor and the ring fill: the frames since its
 * last seek and, when that seek was a loop wrap, whole passes of the old loop
 * before them (a 1/32 beat loop wraps dozens of times in the ring).
