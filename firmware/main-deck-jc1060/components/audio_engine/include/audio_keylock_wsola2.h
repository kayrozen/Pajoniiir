/*
 * Master Tempo WSOLA v2 (JC1060, v326). Same contract as audio_keylock.h: one
 * output frame per call, read callback over the canonical timeline, consumed
 * source frames and the transport position (play_seq) out.
 *
 * v1 crossfades 256-frame grains linearly, aligns them on 2 samples within
 * +/-48 frames and reads fractional positions with linear interpolation (the
 * metallic tone and dull/grainy highs of the HIL). v2:
 *   - stretches at the source rate on whole frames only (no interpolation),
 *     then converts source -> output rate once with the v325 windowed-sinc
 *     audio_resampler (bypassed at ratio 1);
 *   - SoundTouch-style segments: each hop plays one grain for
 *     AUDIO_KEYLOCK2_HOP frames (32 ms at 48 kHz), and only its first
 *     AUDIO_KEYLOCK2_OVERLAP frames (10.7 ms) crossfade from the previous
 *     grain's tail (smoothstep, amplitude-complementary). A permanent 50 %
 *     overlap (tried first) kept every frame a mix of two grains, which on a
 *     polyphonic mix is a standing comb filter;
 *   - grain alignment by normalised cross-correlation of the mono mix over
 *     the overlap within +/-AUDIO_KEYLOCK2_SEEK frames (10.7 ms: one period
 *     of 94 Hz, so bass lines can align too): 4x decimated coarse scan, then
 *     +/-3 frames at full rate. Host A/B on a three-note chord, energy off
 *     the partials at tempo 0.94/1.06: v1 -3 dB, +/-256 search -13..-19 dB,
 *     +/-512 -27..-28.5 dB (signalsmith-stretch, the FFT reference, -27..-32
 *     dB); wider or longer grains gained nothing;
 *   - the search for the next grain is spread over the current hop (a few
 *     reads or one or two correlation candidates per stretched frame), so no
 *     audio block pays for a whole search;
 *   - no added output latency: the timeline already holds the frames ahead.
