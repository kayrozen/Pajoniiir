 * Split out from storage and from the web handler because these are the rules
 * that fail *silently* when they are wrong: a 5-character password is accepted
 * by every layer above and then simply never associates, which on a deck with
 * no serial console is indistinguishable from a firmware fault. Rejecting it at
 * entry, with a reason, is the difference between a typo and an evening.
 *
 * Nothing here stores or logs a credential; callers must not either.
