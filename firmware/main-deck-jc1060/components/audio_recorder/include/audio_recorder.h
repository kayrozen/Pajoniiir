/*
 * P4 master-output microSD recorder — lifecycle and real-time boundary.
 *
 * Records the exact post-limiter stereo master bus. The recorder is optional
 * and strictly subordinate to playback: the PSRAM ring is allocated only at
 * start() behind a free-PSRAM check, and any failure stops the recording while
 * leaving MAIN audio, cue, UI and controller operation running. The audio
 * output task only ever calls audio_recorder_push_master(), which copies one
 * already-rendered block and returns immediately.
 *
 * NOTE: this slice provides the state machine, PSRAM ring lifecycle and writer
 * task draining to a counting placeholder sink. Real microSD file handling
 * (WAV segments, checkpoint/finalize, `.part` recovery) and the shared SD I/O
 * arbiter are added in later slices.
