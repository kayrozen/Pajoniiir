/*
 * microSD WAV segment sink for the P4 master recorder.
 *
 * Owns the open recording file, writes PCM stereo/16-bit segments under
 * /sd/recordings, rolls to a new segment on a sample-rate change or the 1 GiB
 * cap, checkpoints the WAV sizes periodically for crash recovery, and finalizes
 * a segment by patching sizes, syncing and atomically renaming .wav.part ->
 * .wav. All FAT work is serialised through sd_io_gate. Only the low-priority
 * writer task uses this; no audio producer touches it.
